At Battlelog.co we offer the best HWID Spoofer on the market so that you can stay safe while playing. This means that even if you got a ban you can circumvent this, and if you have not been banned yet then you can stay safe from a HWID ban.

 

Why use an HWID Spoofer / Changer?
Now that anti-cheats have become better at combating us - We have come to realize that they ban your computer's unique ID. This means that even if you buy a whole new CD key for the game or if you change your location(IP) you will still be banned.  The way to fix this is by using an HWID Spoofer so that you appear to be on a different PC. Our product is running in ring 0 which makes it one of the safest and most effective on the market.
